    #Scene 1 
    #Written by Wolf

    ###Large centered text on a pastel or watercolor background (if failing that, on a black bg)

    "It's been ten years since we last met."

    ###On click, text fades out, new text fades in

    "And that's my fault."

    "I wonder..."

    "Is there still some place for me in her life?"

    ###Fade into intro CG (if applicable, if not, NVL)

    "C'moooon, Freya. This is your last chance! You missed the funeral, you better not miss the fuckin' train."

    ###Pace Ophelia's sprite back and forth

    "Aaaah... God! I hate this! The anticipation, the uncertainty, my hand in it all—I'm in for an {i}incredibly{/i} awkward cross-country trip if things keep going the way they are."

    "...Of all things, why did you have to miss {i}her{/i} funeral?"

    "We were family."

    "And now you're going to miss our train."

    "No no, reset—this is a reset. Remember your goals, Ophi!"

    "See my oldest friend. Bring her back from the shitshow that is Florida. Show her what real living looks like."

    "...Reconnect."

    "That's why I'm here, not for some emotional attack on her behavior. Open-minded, accepting, loving, affirming. And perhaps a little bit of gremlinery."

    "That's who I should be right now."

    "Slapping my face a bit, I stand up straight and put up my front."

    "Okay, Okay. Now, where could you be, Freya?"

    "The train horn blows, signaling the final call."

    "We have a few minutes at most, Freya. So... please be here this time."

    "An employee gives me one last warning, and I'm forced to make a decision."

    "Is it too late?"

    "...Was I too late?"

    "..."

    "I guess so."

    "Sighing, I grab my luggage tight and turn my back on Florida."

    "Well, goodbye, I guess."

    fre "O-Ophelia?"

    ###Ophelia's sprite should jump out of its skin right here

    oph "Yeack! Jesus fuck, you scared the shit outta me!"

    "My heart pounds in my chest, and not only from the start."

    "{i}She's here.{/i}"

    "In a rush, and for other more shameful reasons, I avoid looking at her and grab her by the wrist."

    oph "You're late, we gotta move!"

    "Pulling her—and her luggage—with me, we rush into our train car, down the aisle, and all the way back to our roomette."

    "Still in a rush, I open the door and glance at what our bereavement bought us: A couple of seats foldable into a bed, a bunk up top, and a collapsed tray table in the wall between."

    "Quite the small room to share with someone I haven't seen in ten years."

    "Continuing to avoid eye contact with her, I put our luggage away and out of sight."

    oph "Whew, you startled the fuck out of me, ya know that?"

    "I look around the room again, finding it the same as it was five seconds ago."

    "I'm quickly losing things to distract myself with."

    "Hahh, okay. I guess this's it."

    "Turning around and collapsing into my seat, I let my breath catch up to me. Freya gently sits just across."

    "Looking up at her, I first notice her cute, stylish jacket and romper. A casual fit, it's kinda cottage-core but I dig it. It fits the Freya that I knew."

    "It's still strange to see, considering the last time we talked, she was... well, not outwardly \"she\". But it fits her better than boy clothes ever did."

    "I finally meet my eyes with hers, and..."

    "{i}Oh no, she's {b}hot{/b}.{/i}"

    "Like, {i}very{/i}."

    "On days like these, it's a blessing that I'm so very gay."

    "No! Focus, Ophelia! Now's not the time!"

    oph "It's, uhh, been a long time, hasn't it?"

    fre "...Yeah. It has."

    oph "Well, I have to say, you look fucking {i}stunning{/i}."

    "Freya awkwardly smiles, embarrassed by the compliment."

    oph "Like, {i}really{/i}. You're more... {i}you{/i} than I've ever seen you."

    "She curls up, trying to hide her happiness behind her closed hands."

    "Cute."

    oph "So, what've you been up to, over here in the \"sunshine state\"?"

    "She scoffs, just as aware as I am that Florida is anything but."

    fre "Enjoying what I can. Jacksonville... could be worse, I suppose."

    oph "Could it? Could it {i}really{/i}?"

    "Freya laughs, shaking her head."

    fre "No, I guess not."

    oph "You at least find something fun to pass the time?"

    fre "Ehh, I've been serving for a while if that counts. It pays the bills at least."

    oph "Oh dear."

    "She shrugs."

    fre "Could be worse."

    oph "You keep saying that."

    oph "Well, you'll be out of that place soon enough. I'm not going to lie to you—one of my goals here is to convince you to move to Oregon."

    oph "It's better for you in many, many ways."

    "She winces, retreating."

    fre "That's..."

    oph "A big ask? I know. But if I have my way, all of your concerns will be addressed by the time we hit the ground in Portland."

    oph "And I'm confident that I can be pretty convincing..."

    "I wink at her, and she rolls her eyes."

    fre "Good to see you haven't changed at all."

    oph "And neither have you. Well, outside of the obvious. Deep down, you're the Freya I've always loved. Just, now your outside matches what was always on the inside."

    oph "But! Bathing you in compliments won't get you to stay with me."

    oph "Making up for lost time will."

    "Right?"
