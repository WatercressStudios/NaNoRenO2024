    "Did last night really happen?"

    "Am I the luckiest fucking girl this side of the Mississippi?"

    "I kissed Freya. And more importantly, {i}Freya kissed me{/i}."

    "And here she is now, asleep in my arms. This isn't the first time we've done this, but... everything's different now."

    "I had always thought, \"If only she were a girl.\". I got my wish tenfold."

    "I was afraid that she would have fallen out of love with me."

    "But more than that, I was absolutely terrified that she'd fade away, an echo of time that I'd always remember but never be able to touch."

    "But time is just another type of distance, one you can always traverse."

    "You just have to do one simple, painful, scary thing: reach out."

    "And I did."

    "And here we are now."

    #Some side sprite scripting can probably go below if we have the time.

    "She stirs, slowly blinking at me with a simple smile."

    fre "Heyy Ophi."

    oph "Heyyy to you too, Frey. Did you get some good sleep?"

    fre "Yeeahh, it was wonderful."

    "Mother of Christ, her sleepy voice is so fucking cute."

    oph "That makes one of us. Could barely sleep, for more reasons than the train."

    "She rolls over completely, reaching out to me. Accepting her embrace, we hold each other tight enough to make up for all the years of lost time."

    "I don't think I'll ever stop beating myself up for that. Ten years. That's so {i}long{/i}. Imagine where we'd be."

    "...Maybe we'd be married."

    "Maybe we would own a home somewhere in the suburbs of Portland."

    "Hah! As if we'll ever be homeowners."

    "But... wives? Better late than never."

    "Today, I'll have to come clean to her. Tell her why I stopped talking to her. Why I pushed her away."

    "I give her a light kiss on the forehead, slowly unwrapping myself from her."

    oph "I gotta freshen up, 'kay?"

    fre "'Kayy."

    "I take a little extra time in the bathroom than I originally intended, washing my face and trying not to hate myself."

    "I'm so very happy to have her, but the weight has only gotten heavier. Why {i}did{/i} I stop talking to her?"

    "I loved her. Even if it was just as friends, I did truly love her. We were more than found family. We did everything together. Inseparable in every sense of the word."

    "Fuck it. I don't want to worry her more than I already have, so I should rip this bandaid off too."

    "Arriving back to our roomette, I help Freya up to her feet, and she takes her turn."

    o "It was back when I was out to her but not anybody else. Things with mom and dad were rough."

    o "They didn't fight, least not where I could see, but they didn't enjoy each other either."

    o "I had been asking grandma for help on how to talk to them about queer shit. It hurt being scared I'd just make things worse."

    f "God, that's relatable. It's always a gamble if they'll take it well or just bottle it up until they explode."

    o "Nah, it was more like, I felt like I didn't matter enough to bother them about it. I'm just a kid, they have adult crap to worry about, don't they?"

    o "It was a chilly evening, just before Thanksgiving break. I told them I was gonna go study with her after dinner."

    o "Her house was warm."

    o "It was like Christmas when I was younger, back when everything was normal."

    f "It's hard not to miss those days, sometimes."

    o "Oh, did I ever tell you about the video game she got me when I was twelve?"

    o "Except it was rated M, and for a console we didn't own."

    f "Of course I remember. I'm the one you gave it to!"

    o "Pfftâ€”That's right, isn't it? God, that was such a long time ago."

    o "Anyway, grandma sat me down at the table and made cookies."

    o "She poured me this huge cup of lemonade, back in elementary I could've sworn it was almost as tall as I was."

    o "I talked to her about this girl I was crushing on in class, and how I wanted things to be alright with my mom and dad."

    o "I told her how I was scared people wouldn't like me anymore if I came out at school."

    g "Ohohoho!~ You don't need to worry about that, dearie."

    g "If people are assholes to you over something as quaint as this, they aren't worth your time."

    g "Have faith in yourself, and perhaps a pinch of confidence. Alright, sweetheart?"

    f "That sounds like the stuff she'd say to me, too."

    o "Gran was always the headstrong type. Not the 'my way or the highway' kind, but..."

    g "Kindness isn't just about being patient and considerate. You have to value yourself enough to know when to stay firm, too."

    g "Love your neighbor as yourself. That doesn't mean one should always sacrifice for the other. It means you need to stand as equals."

    o "It's things like that that I always remember most."

    o "She always told me to try and listen to my heart."

    o "If you don't know your wants and needs, being selfless isn't even a choice."

    o "The first step is to know who you want to be. For yourself, not what others want you to be."

    g "...It took me a long time to become the woman I am, you know."

    g "Back in the old days, I had a lot of friends. People who were tired, and stressed, and just lost and confused in this mess they called life."

    g "It wasn't until then that I really understood what being a good person meant. It isn't always easy, but if it were then it wouldn't be special."

    g "Then before I knew it, I was on the front lines with your grandfather, throwing bricks back in '69. Ohohohoho!~"

    o "Those stories of hers always sounded painful, but she'd always tell it with a smile and a laugh. I didn't get why she felt proud of it back then."

    g "The only reason we have the lives we do is because of the people around us."

    g "The ones who built the world we live in today, and the ones who help our hearts when we're at our worst."

    g "Even when it's hard, women like me can't help but do what we can."

    g "It wasn't until seeing them firsthand that I really understood how much being there meant for people."

    g "...Back then, it hurt seeing so many people run from their families. I'm thankful it's better than it used to be, even if there're still things to solve."

    g "More than anything, I think trust is what's important."

    g "You need to have faith in your own heart. Fear, and anxiety, and shame can all cloud your honest feelings. You can't know what's true if your heart's not on solid ground."

    g "Find the people you can trust, and who can do the same for you. The ones you can open your heart to without them saying you're broken."

    g "You don't need to be 'fixed.' You don't need people crying about how you're one of nature's defects."

    g "You're not a corrupted youth, and you're not a troubled would-be housewife."

    g "What matters isn't the face you put on, it's the you inside your heart. The one that deserves to shine as bright as the stars in the sky."

    g "You're beautiful as you are. The real you, Ophelia."

    o "I still think about her, whenever I'm down. It always cheers me up a little."

    oph "What do you mean, Freya? You're the one who didn't fuck off across the country."

    fre "Seeing her as the dementia got worse, it was like... it felt like one of the few real supports I had was going away."

    fre "I couldn't help but cry over it."

    fre "And then you had the pandemic, turning me into an even worse shut in, and all the fucking politics these days..."

    fre "I felt like I was coming apart at the seams."

    fre "And I feel guilty, because... if only I were a better person, I'd have been able to see her again."

    fre "I always told myself I'd go check on her when I felt ready. Then one day, she was just gone."

    fre "I'm ashamed of not being good enough. I dunno how I'm supposed to feel about that."

    oph "If she were here now, she'd probably ruffle your head around and tell you not to worry."

    oph "Nobody needs to be perfect. Life'd be miserable if we beat ourselves up over every little thing."

    oph "It's not about always needing to be your best. If you have an off day, then that's okay."

    oph "But... it's hard to keep moving forward if you aren't able to forgive yourself too, you know?"

    oph "So don't worry. If there's anything after all of this, Grandma'd be laughing her ass off with grandpa and all her old friends."

    oph "And even if you could've been around more, I'm sure she'd be thankful for having you for so long. Alright?"

    fre "That's... Yeah."

    "Freya turns her head down, then rubs her eyes."

    fre "Thank you, Ophelia."

    oph "Any time, Frey. I'm here for you, and I'm not going to change any time soon."

    oph "And..."

    "This is the best chance I'll get to clear the air. To tell her why I stopped talking to her."

    "To apologize, from the bottom of my heart."

    "I take a deep breath, and continue."

    oph "I think I get why you missed her funeral, now. Wanting to remember her as she was... being afraid of accepting itâ€”and you probably didn't want to see me too much, either."

    "Freya avoids looking at me, simply nodding."

    "I can tell, one word and she'll fall apart."

    "I understand. Oh God, do I understand."

    oph "Like you, I always wanted to visit her. Like you, I always held it off, until it was too late."

    oph "...And I felt the same with you."

    oph "I always wanted to talk to you."

    oph "I have so many draft messages, like time capsules for each day, each month, each yearâ€”all unsent."

    oph "But every time I talked with you, it hurt more, and more and more. I felt like I had lost something."

    oph "Like something was torn from me."

    "I sigh, a ragged sigh, holding my own emotions at bay."

    oph "\"What could have been.\""

    oph "I couldn't move forward, because I was trapped in the past. My body was in Portland, but my soul was in Jacksonville."

    oph "And all I could do was move on."

    oph "Slowly, I texted you less and less. I numbed myself. Forced myself to make new friends, to do whatever I could to fit in to my new circumstance."

    oph "Otherwise... I don't think I would have survived."

    oph "And I finally found friends! A home! Somewhere to belong! A band, and a rather successful one."

    oph "No fights, no drama, just family."

    oph "One I wanted to introduce to you, one day."

    oph "But that all ended when our lead singer, the soul of the band, passed away."

    oph "It just wasn't the same. We split up, and for years, I was a zombie... and I missed that funeral."

    oph "But I couldn't miss this one. I knew that I couldn't keep making the same stupid fucking mistakes."

    oph "It was a hail mary, trying to crawl my way back."

    oph "And you did it. Despite every reason in the world, you came back to me."

    oph "I came back to you, and you came back to me."

    oph "In a million other timelines, a million other decisions, we may never have had this chance."

    oph "But here, now, we do."

    oph "I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. I hurt you. I hurt you {b}a lot{/b}."

    oph "And you still gave me a chance."

    oph "But that's you, isn't it, Frey?"

    oph "No matter what, you give people a chance."

    oph "And that's one of the countless reasons why..."

    oph "I love you."

    "Her gaze jumps back to me, the weight of my words heavy on her."

    fre "I..."

    "She struggles, unable to find the right words. In the end, no words are necessary. She lunges forward, embracing me in a hug so tight it's as if she's trying to hold me down, to keep me from running away again."

    "She whispers, faintly, into my ear."

    fre "I love you too."

    fre "And I'm sorry too."

    "With that, we do nothing but hold each other for what feels like hours."

    "Ten years of longing. Ten years of time."

    n "Stepping off the train in LA is promising. No, it isn't the city itself, I hadn't seen any part of it yet. But Freya is at my side, blushing terribly at how easily our fingers intertwine."

    n "So yeah, life is going pretty well."

    n "But the city is enormous, and we're right at the center of it. Each direction we could pick seems like it would take us to a completely different scene."
    
    n "We have a few hours before the train leaves again. Freya says something about how the station connects to all reaches of the sprawling city."

    n "\"No,\" I say firmly, already somewhat nauseated at the idea of getting on {i}another{/i} train. \"If we can't walk where we're going, I don't want it.\""
    
    n "Freya doesn't argue with that. Solid ground is too much of a delicacy at this point."
    
    n "So our legs carry us away, down every street that catches our eye. We take photos in front of murals painted over entire buildings."
    
    n "We mingle with the crowds, practically swimming through countless memorable faces, and yet my eyes keep being pulled toward Freya's."
    
    n "I notice she seems a bit hesitant, keeping her head low, her fingers nearly slipping free from my own."
    
    n "I lean in closer, talking low enough that only she can hear me. \"Hey,\" I squeeze her hand to reassure her."
    
    n "\"This isn't Florida or Texas, you know.\""
    
    n "She looks up, almost looking surprised. She brushes her hair out of her face. \"Yeah, I guess you're right.\""
    
    n "The way her expression brightens, I could live off that feeling."
    
    n "\"Hey, ya hungry?\" I ask."
    
    n "\"Unbelievably.\""
    
    n "\"Want something quick and easy, orâ€”\""
    
    n "Freya jerks my arm in excitement. \"We're in Los Angeles! I want something totally new! And no, you are {i}not{/i} taking me to In'N'Out.\""
    
    n "\"But everyone says they're {i}sooooo good!{/i}\""
    
    n "\"{i}I don't care!{/i}\""
    
    n "\"Well what WOULD be new to you, then?\""

    n "Freya contemplates our options, looking around, checking the map. The hamster wheel is really spinning."

    n "Suddenly I get an idea. My eyes go wide. \"You haven't tried hot pot before, have you?\""

    n "Freya gives me a condescending smile. \"I've absolutely smoked weed before.\""
    
    n "This statement sends me mentally staggering. \"That's not... no. {i}Hot pot{/i}. Like the Asian cuisine.\""
    
    n "Freya shrugs. \"Oh like what you said was clearly not just some kind of west coast euphemism for getting high.\""
    
    n "\"Are you hungry or are you going to argue linguistics with me?\""
    
    n "\"I'm hungry!\""
    
    n "\"Alright!\""
    
    n "Our voices progressively rise to exceed each other, but our smiles never fade. We walk over to Chinatown and find a cute little hot pot spot."

    n "God, it really does sound like a euphemism."
    
    n "We get seated, and I explain the whole premise to Freya while the broth heats up. Freya defers to my choices, having little clue what to make of it all."

    n "She looks thrilled when the cuts of meat arrive. She looks notably less thrilled when the four different variations of mushroom arrive."

    n "With a little encouragement, and maybe a threat or two, she finally goes for it."
    
    n "And predictably, she falls in love with foods she had no concept of just twenty minutes earlier."
    
    n "I try to hold back laughter as she tucks the longest mushrooms into her lip to pretend like they're fangs. Big, floppy fangs."

    n "We leave very satisfied, possibly even sluggish. But we have time for one more adventure and I know exactly where I want to take us."
    
    n "I order a rideshare and we start weaving through the cityscape."
    
    n "\"Where are we going?\" Freya asks."

    n "\"You'll find out soon.\" I wink."

    n "By the time we're nearly there, it becomes kind of obvious. The soft, swelling roar of the waves is one clue."
    
    n "The way the distance runs out of buildings is another."
    
    n "Freya's eyes light up and she takes the lead as we ride past the last few buildings until there's nothing ahead of us but sand and sea."

    n "We get out, walking past the pier to feel the soft crunch of sand under us."
    
    n "It feels good to just stand there a moment, soaking in the relief of finding a new shore. Weirdly familiar for us Floridians, and yet so, so far away."

    n "The Pacific Ocean just hits different. We don't say another word as we wait and watch the low-hanging sun slowly dip down to kiss the waves."
    
    n "It's a sight that inspires songs, one that has been captured countless times to be put in films time and time again."
    
    n "And here it was, for real, right in front of us."
    
    n "The final sliver of the sun finally disappears below the horizon, and all is silent."
    
    n "Especially Freya, still sitting in the sand, hugging her knees, staring outward."
    
    n "I feel the wind tugging at my clothes and my hair. I could stay here forever, but it's getting late. I nudge Freya."
    
    n "\"We should get back to the station.\""
    
    n "Freya takes a long breath, then nods. She stands, quietly kissing my cheek."
    
    n "\"Thanks for this. For everything. I can't imagine still being back...\" she trails off."

    n "I smile, draping my arms over her shoulders. \"But you're not. You're here. With me.\""

    n "I kiss her softly, a sense of relief washing over us both."
    
    n "The trip back to the station is quiet. LA's nightlife is already in full swing, but we're both drifting, our only tether being each other's hands."
    
    n "We get back on the train, ready for the journey ahead."

    n "But my heart is already beginning to sink. Because I'm not ready for this trip to end."
